Example of usage:
Add next to your .bashrc

source <path to repo>/.bashrc

Then create symbolic links to
~/.vim -> ///.vim
~/.vimrc -> ///.vim/.vimrc
~/.config/ranger -> ///ranger

Install nvr to open files from ranger in new tabs

Run:
nvim -c "terminal ranger"

Known issue:
Ctrl+O doestn't work in ranger and bash under OSX in both iTerm2 and Terminal. 
This shortcut works in VimR only if you open ranger from nvim nested terminal.
